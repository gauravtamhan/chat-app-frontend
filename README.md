## Features

A few notable features of the app include:

## Future Thoughts/Additions

Given more time on the project a few areas that I would like to add/improve on include:

- Full accessability audit for [WCAG 2.1 level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) compliance
- Unit testing
- Theme support (light/dark mode)
- Views for handling loading state(s), such as for any potential async calls
- Browser local storage for persisting chat info on reload
- Additional features like group chat support
